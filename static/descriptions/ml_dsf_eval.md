# 🧠 Quantifying Significance of Small Businesses

> A data-driven framework that evaluates and ranks small businesses based on their holistic impact on local communities — empowering urban planners, entrepreneurs, and policymakers.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project introduces a novel approach to understanding the real-world value of small businesses within urban neighborhoods. By combining economic data with public sentiment and infrastructure metrics, we created a success score to quantify how a business contributes to its local environment — economically, socially, and physically.

---

## 💡 Motivation

Small businesses are often the heartbeat of a neighborhood — yet, their value is difficult to quantify. This project seeks to measure that significance through a multidimensional lens, factoring in not just revenue or reviews, but walkability, transit accessibility, and neighborhood context. The goal: provide a scalable way to support sustainable local economies and smarter urban development.

## 🔍 Architecture / Design

- Modular pipeline with the following stages:
  1. Data ingestion from census + local review platforms
  2. Feature engineering and transformation
  3. Clustering for behavioral grouping of businesses
  4. Regression-based modeling and scoring
  5. Geospatial analysis of community impact

- Results were validated across **community districts in Queens**, demonstrating real-world accuracy and insight
