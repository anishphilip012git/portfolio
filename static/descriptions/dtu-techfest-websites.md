# 🎉 DTU Techfest Websites – University Event Platforms & Online Competitions

> Developed and deployed responsive, scalable web platforms for technical fests and national-level competitions at Delhi Technological University (DTU), impacting 10,000+ users across multiple years and events.

---

## 🚀 Overview

As part of DTU’s tech culture, I contributed to the **design and development of multiple websites** for high-impact events like:
- 🔧 **Cogenesis** – the annual technical fest of the CSE department
- 🧩 **Cryptex** – an online cryptic hunt that attracted over 10K+ participants
- 🎨 **Phoenix** – with banner design and web deployment in public settings (e.g., Delhi Metro promos)

The work spanned everything from **frontend (Bootstrap, responsive design)** to **backend logic in PHP**, to handling **user load and session management** for competitions in real time.

## 💡 Motivation

The goal was to create engaging, accessible, and high-performance web experiences to:
- Showcase DTU’s tech identity
- Run high-traffic national online competitions
- Enable real-time tracking of quiz/game sessions
- Deliver a great user experience across desktop and mobile

## 📱 CSI Android App – DTU Chapter

As President of the **Computer Society of India (CSI – DTU Chapter)** and the **Society of Software Engineers**, I led the development of a **CSI Android app** to keep students connected with upcoming events, coding competitions, and workshops.

### Key Features:
- 📰 News feed for event announcements and technical talks
- 📅 Schedule planner with reminders for workshops and hackathons
- 🛠️ Designed for performance and offline support using local caching
- 🔗 Linked with web assets and registration portals

This app gave members a **direct channel for tech community updates**, reducing information loss and boosting participation across campus.

## 📚 Notes

This project represents my **first hands-on, end-to-end delivery** of real-world tech platforms. It sparked my long-term interest in **building performant systems** that directly **serve users at scale**, and has shaped my understanding of user-focused engineering ever since.
