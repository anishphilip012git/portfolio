# 🧠 Stock Trading with Reinforcement Learning Insights

> A deep dive into the use of reinforcement learning algorithms for designing and optimizing financial trading systems — balancing prediction, reward maximization, and market volatility.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project investigates how **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** can be applied to improve algorithmic trading strategies in stock markets. By implementing and comparing a variety of RL models such as **Temporal Q-Learning**, **LSTM networks**, and **K-Line Clustering**, we explored which methods offer the most effective balance of accuracy, risk management, and profitability across single and multi-stock pools.

## 💡 Motivation

Financial markets are dynamic, uncertain, and complex — and traditional models often fall short in capturing such volatility. The goal of this project was to explore **RL-based trading agents** capable of learning optimal strategies through interaction with historical market data, delivering intelligent, adaptive trading behavior.
