### 🔍 **Pro Tips (How to Structure Resume for Each Level)**
To keep it sharp and relevant:
- Start each bullet with a **strong action verb** and quantify impact when possible.
- For **ML contributions**, always tie them to **real-world outcomes** (e.g., reduced backlog, improved detection, faster decision-making).
- Keep the **tech stack visible** in context, but not overwhelming.

If you want, I can turn this into a **formatted LaTeX or PDF resume section** or help integrate it into your existing resume. Want me to do that next?
