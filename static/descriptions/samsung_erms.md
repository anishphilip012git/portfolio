# 🧠 Samsung Email Response Management System (ERMS)

> A real-time, AI-enhanced platform built to transform Samsung Customer Care. Designed with a customer-first mindset, ERMS dramatically reduced ticket resolution times and improved service quality by automating workflows, intelligently routing queries, and enabling faster agent response.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Samsung ERMS** was developed to directly improve the experience of Samsung’s end customers by eliminating delays, misrouted tickets, and untracked support queries. With daily volumes exceeding **5,000 customer emails**, the system provided fast, intelligent, and fair routing of issues to the right support agents — ensuring customers got answers **faster, more consistently, and with greater accuracy**.

This project reflects a deep commitment to **customer obsession**, where the focus was not just on agent efficiency, but on *how quickly and effectively real users were getting help*.

---

## 💡 Motivation

Customer trust is earned through **responsive and accurate support**. Before ERMS, manual processes led to:
- Lost or delayed email responses
- Inconsistent ticket triaging
- No visibility into agent workloads or resolution times

The goal was to **automate intelligently**, not just to save effort — but to **respect the customer’s time and urgency**.
