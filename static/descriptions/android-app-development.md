# 📱 Android App Development – Public Health Awareness App

> Developed a government-backed Android app as part of an internship at Appsolute Pvt. Ltd., focused on raising awareness about swine flu prevention and symptoms. Contributed to mobile UI design, static content structuring, and launch readiness during my undergraduate studies at DTU.

## 🚀 Overview

This project was built under the guidance of Appsolute Pvt. Ltd. as part of a **public awareness campaign promoted by local health authorities**. The Android app aimed to educate users on swine flu symptoms, prevention techniques, and emergency resources during a time of rising health concern.

The app focused on **clarity, accessibility, and reach**, using clean UI layouts and concise, multilingual content to serve a wide audience — particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.

## 💡 Motivation

Swine flu had become a public health priority in the region, and there was a need for **mobile-first education and outreach**. The app served as a digital pamphlet that could reach thousands through a lightweight Android application.

My role was to:
- Contribute to **UI/UX design for Android**
- Build static screens with **localized health content**
- Ensure smooth navigation, readability, and performance on entry-level Android phones
